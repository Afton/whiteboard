Hardware and Software Environment
=================================

  Hardware: Anything that runs Java SE 5.0 JRE with network support
  Software: Any operating environment with Java SE 5.0 JRE


Final Project
=============

  Collaborative whiteboarding application

  We aim to design a vector-based peer-to-peer drawing application.  Users will join to known peers and share a whiteboard.  Each user's drawings will appear on all his peers whiteboards as well.
  
  We hope to implement more advanced features such as chatting, personal messaging, permissions controls on the drawings and on the whiteboard (kicking/banning users).  We'd also like to implement cut/copy/paste and undo/redo.


Major Risks and Risk Mitigation
===============================

  Project scope might be too large for alloted time
   - create list of features that must, should, may be implemented
   - this "must-should-maybe" list could be applied to each milestone, although all but the last milestone will probably just have "must" (shoulds and maybes being pushed down into later milestones)

  Project scope might be too small for alloted time
   - add more features (implement all of the "wish-list")

  Shape protocol may be too complex
   - can use Java serialized Objects instead
